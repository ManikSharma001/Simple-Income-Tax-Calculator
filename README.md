# Simple-Income-Tax-Calculator
This repository contains two programs: one for the command line and one for the internal python shell. Both these programs take in a person's employment income in the 2020 tax season and will output the amount needed to pay. Note: no tax credits are applied so the numbers that you receive may not be accurate.
